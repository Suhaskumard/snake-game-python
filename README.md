# 🐍 Snake Game (Python)

## 📌 Overview
This is a classic **Snake Game** implemented using **Python and Pygame**.  
The player controls the snake using arrow keys, eats food to grow longer, and avoids collisions with walls and itself.

This project demonstrates **game loop logic, collision detection, event handling, and basic graphics rendering**.

## 🎯 Features
- Classic Snake gameplay
- Keyboard controls (arrow keys)
- Snake growth on eating food
- Wall and self-collision detection
- Score tracking
- Replay or quit option after game over


## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python
- **Library:** Pygame
- **Concepts Used:**
  - Game loop
  - Event handling
  - Collision detection
  - 2D graphics rendering
